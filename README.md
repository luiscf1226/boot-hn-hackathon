# AI Coding Agent

AI-powered coding assistant with terminal UI for code analysis, commit messages, and project management.

## About This Project

This is a hackathon project for boot.dev!

First of all I want to be honest. I did use AI for the UI with copilot and tab. I had no experience with textual and toml for creating projects, but the project idea, commands and functions were an idea from a boot.dev course!

I'm not sure if I'm gonna win but I'm just happy to represent Honduras and hope at least you found it interesting! ðŸ‡­ðŸ‡³

## Adding New Commands

To add a new command:

1. **Create command file** in `app/commands/`:
   ```python
   # app/commands/my_command.py
   from app.commands.base import BaseCommand
   
   class MyCommand(BaseCommand):
       async def execute(self, *args, **kwargs):
           return {"success": True, "message": "Command executed!"}
   ```

2. **Add to command enum** in `app/commands/command_enum.py`:
   ```python
   MY_COMMAND = "mycommand"
   ```

3. **Register in command manager** in `app/commands/command_manager.py`:
   ```python
   from app.commands.my_command import MyCommand
   self._commands[AgentCommand.MY_COMMAND] = MyCommand
   ```

4. **Add to UI** in `app/ui/components/commands_panel.py` for display
